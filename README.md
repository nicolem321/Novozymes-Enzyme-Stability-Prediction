# Novozymes-Enzyme-Stability-Prediction

The project team tackled the problem of predicting protein melting temperatures by designing and implementing a machine learning model. The team utilized a variety of techniques, including feature engineering and model selection, to create a model that was able to accurately predict the melting temperatures of proteins. To create the model, the team first preprocessed the data by cleaning and transforming the raw data into a format that was suitable for modeling. This involved removing missing or irrelevant data and extracting relevant features from the data that could be used by the model to make predictions. Next, the team used a combination of feature engineering and model selection to train the model. Feature engineering involved selecting and creating new features from the data that would provide the model with additional information that could be used to make more accurate predictions. Once the model was trained, the team evaluated its performance using a variety of metrics, including accuracy, precision, and recall. These metrics were used to assess the model's ability to accurately predict protein melting temperatures, as well as its ability to generalize to unseen data.
